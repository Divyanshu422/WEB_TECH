# Lecture 1:

- What is Emmet?
  - Emmet is a free, open-source toolkit for web developers that helps speed up coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other languages.

# what we have done in lecture 1?

- Injected the element using the JS code
- included the React in the code using `CDN` links

# Lecture 2:

- Install the package.json file using `npm init -y`
- Install the parcel (a bundler) using following command `npm install -D parcel`. the `-D` is flag which signify that the dependency added is development phase not for the normal phase
- Difference btw tilde [~] vs carot [^].
- adding the .gitignore file
- to iginte the code: we need to run following command `npx parcel index.html`
- rather than using CDN link for installing the react into the application. the other way is to install the react: `npm i react` and `npm i react-dom`
